## Description

This project analyzes historical data from January to May 2024 to project future expenses for establishing a pharmacy in Colombia. Using Machine Learning techniques implemented in Python, various models were explored, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Ridge Regression. Additionally, RandomizedSearchCV was used for hyperparameter optimization, and dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to enhance model efficiency. The main objective is to provide an accurate and reliable projection of expenses over five years.
